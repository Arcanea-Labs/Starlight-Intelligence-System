# Starlight-Intelligence-System

Starlight Intelligence System (SIS) is the application-agnostic brain and memory core that powers the Starlight ecosystem. It stores knowledge and thought logs for AI assistants like Arcanea, FrankX, and Akamoto so they can reason across long timelines.

SIS provides long-term reasoning, daily thought logging, and AI agent memory capabilities. The notes, templates, agents, connectors, and core modules in this repository come together to form that persistent layer for your work with language models.
